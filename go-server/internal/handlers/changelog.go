// CHANGELOG DATE POLICY
// =====================
// Each entry's Date field must reflect the ACTUAL date the feature shipped or
// the incident occurred — NOT the version number prefix, NOT "today", and NOT
// the date the changelog entry was written. Version numbers (26.14.x, 26.13.x)
// are feature-level counters and do NOT encode dates.
//
// When adding a new entry:
//  1. Determine the real ship/event date.
//  2. Use (or create) a named date constant below.
//  3. Reference the constant — never inline a date string.
//
// Canonical date mapping (verified Feb 28, 2026):

Notes that quarantine sequesters authentication failures while preserving full DMARC forensic telemetry (RFC 7489 §7), and that some organizations maintain quarantine rather than reject as a deliberate monitoring strategy.

Exit button restyled as scotopic-correct emergency exit sign — solid #cc3030 with red glow, uppercase, fa-sign-out-alt icon, hover brightens to #ff4040. Toggle button on results page now navigates to standard view instead of just removing CSS class (prevented users getting stuck on covert template with standard styling). Hardened toggle logic to redirect whenever analysis ID is present regardless of report mode value. Added x-public-suffix meta tag to results_covert.html for correct exit routing.",
